### Elaborated Agenda

0. Reminder: Everything should mesh with [the main pangeo site](http://pangeo.io/)
1. Roll call: Name, where, focus
    - Rob: Remarks on inclusivity and Sir Not Appearing In This Call
    
    * Dax Asst Prof QCNY: Using pangeo with primary undergrads: OOI: Develop those datasets; interest based on transitioning students from mouse-competent to independent data scientist
    * Kevin Tyle at U.Albany IT management: Pangeo data wg. Get students equipped for the jobs waiting for them; people who have domain + cloud + github + data standards: Valued skill set. Planning an online class that will hopefully <---> wg benefit: Advanced geosci data visualization. Also will attend Mind The Gap meeting in Boulder next month: Building coursework. 
    * Jim Bednar at Anaconda: Working on contracts e.g. with USACE which claim they will provide best practices esp in data visualization and handling; and 'how to get your job done'; so need to make materials available such that they are coordinated across pangeo. 
2. Recap the three pillars of pangeo
    - The Pangeo project serves as a coordination point between scientists, software, and computing infrastructure 
      - Community building: Foster collaboration around open source scientific Python ecosystem for O/A/L/CS
      - Domain tool-building: Support development of domain-specific geoscience packages
      - Scale-tech building: Improve scalability of these tools, i.e. operate on large datasets
3. Recap of "input to date" on pangeo education
    - Practical considerations
      - To work on this requires support of some sort; what is pending? what might we apply for?
        - Example (past): [NSF 19-524](https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?WT.z_pims_id=505342&ods_key=nsf19524)
      - "Thanks for the pod... by the way who pays for this?"
      - Schedule: Year 2 (NASA) starts in August; many other gears also turning
      - What are the different ways that pangeo education goes into practice? (list courses, hackweeks, etc)
      - Meetings
        - Joe report on France meeting?
        - August meeting is pending
        - pangeo could/should spin up its own hackweek: Discuss
        - pangeo could/should spin up its own week-long conference (say summer 2020): Discuss.
      - What does community building look like? 
        - Bring in more scientists; so what is in it for them?
        - Bring in more developers; so what is in it for them?
        - How does publishing domain code create positive feedback?
    - method and philosophy
      - "A cascade of education materials" (similar size, smaller quanta composable units)
        - modularized from a 20 minute talk to a 4 hour AGU tutorial to multi-day presence at hackweek 
      - Identify typical user's concerns (teach only what is necessary (best guess))
      - 5 or 6 virtual sprints per year, virtual working space
      - Need a ***testing protocol and testing schedule*** for content
      - Pedagogical issues: Expert blind spot, ***debugging***, time-to-proficiency estimation, what else?
      - Do-and-capture mantra
    - Existing content
      - Damien's OA s/w carpentry (Example review question: 'Does this include `dask`?')
      - Need a review/overhaul of the table presented on the 
[*education-material* repo main page](https://github.com/pangeo-data/education-material)
      - Z2JHub: Good exemplar project model for content
        - Z2Pangeo is nice but too general; suggesting Z2PangeoX where X is the focus
    - Synthesis and Wheel Non-Reinvention
      - Let's consider R-OpenSci and Pi-OpenSci: Peer review s/w publication
      - Z2Pangeo >> Z2JHub???
      - "Focus on building better documentation elsewhere" not just += the pangeo portfolio (tag!)
      - Align with NCAR's ongoing efforts, NCL transition, etc?
4. Open discussion: What else should be in the mix
5. Call tempo through August
6. Actions
    - Write up notes from this call (Rob)
    - Schedule next call ()
    - Create working space ()
    - Draft a ***Game Plan*** for review ()
      - Participants with roles, deliverables; sprint timing (first one to end Aug 16?)
    - Review related open issues ()
      - Issue #521 at pangeo-data/pangeo: Glacier model proposal by fmaussion: Follow-up?
      - Issue #440 at pangeo-data/pangeo: Resources for education events: We need an owner for this sub-topic (especially load testing)
      - Issues #411 and #575 require review with follow-up with contributors >> Game Plan
    - Other? ()
